# Hog-SVM-training-for-car-detection-binary-classification
This is my project to classify input images into 2 subset which is car and non-car  
Cardata.rar contains training images and test images for my work. Read Readme.txt inside this folder for more information about the use of it  
**How to use**: After running program please note that:
- press n to see the next picture
- press b to see the previous picture
- to skip the picture results in order to the final results of precision and recall: press esc(remember that only click esc if u want to see precision and recall and u had not clicked 'b' before cause it will lead to a false results( my code was not set up to deal with this)  
***Important***:My code is right and get to the finals results but while running code, u probably get failed by unsetting project property, so if u get bug like *missing .dll file* or *failed at 'chFolderpath' in load_images function* or *failed at    svm->train*, just keep up searching on stackoverflow u will find out solution  
**Goodluck**
