# Hog-SVM-training-for-car-detection-binary-classification
This is my project to classify input images into 2 subset which is car and non-car
How to use: After running program please note that:
- press n to see the next picture
- press b to see the previous picture
- to skip the picture results in order to the final results of precision and recall: press esc(remember that only click esc if u want to see precision and recall and u had not clicked 'b' before cause it will lead to a false results( my code was not set up to deal with this)
