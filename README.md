# Hog-SVM-training-for-car-detection-binary-classification
This is my project to classify input images into 2 subset which is car and non-car  
Cardata.rar contains training images and test images for my work. Read Readme.txt inside this folder for more information about the use of it  
**How to use**: After running program please note that:
- press n to see the next picture
- press b to see the previous picture
- to skip the picture results in order to the final results of precision and recall: press esc(remember that only click esc if u want to see precision and recall and u had not clicked 'b' before cause it would lead to a false results( my code was not set up to deal with this)  
- the recognition evaluation( precision and recall) is based on Jaccard index( you can see it at the beginning of the code). You can change it to gain another results of precision and recall. Jaccard index is based on the requirement of your work
***Important***:My code is right and got the finals results but while running code, u probably get failed by unsetting project property, so if u get bug like *missing .dll file* or *failed at 'chFolderpath' in load_images function* or *failed at svm->train*, just keep up searching on stackoverflow u will find out solution  
**Goodluck**
